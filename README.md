# BACKEND-THEORY

## Things to learn as a backend engineer
1. Communication protocols:
 - Communication protocols. (TCP, UDP), Why tcp slow?

 - How http work? What is HTTP?

 - Web sockets

 - GRPC

 - RFCs




2.  Web servers

Etags, etags mechanism , caching, threads, 

3. Database engineering

Log strcutured, tree structured, relational databases, nosql
 - Acid
 - Atomicity
 - Durabiloity
 - Isolation

4. Proxy

 - microservices
 - Reverse Proxy
 - Caching layers
 - Load Balancers
 - TLS termination
 - Services mreshes

5. Caching

 - Messaging system. (queue, RabbitMQ)

6. Web frameworks

7. Message Format (XML, Json)

8. Security (Network sec, Data security)

## Mac address


A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique identifier assigned to the network interface of a device, such as a computer, smartphone, or router. It is used to identify and communicate with devices on a local network, like a Wi-Fi or Ethernet network.

- The MAC address is typically a 12-character alphanumeric string (48 bits), displayed in six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by colons or hyphens. For example, 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E.

- MAC addresses are used at the data link layer of the OSI model to ensure devices can be properly identified on a network, especially in local area networks (LANs).

MAC address is not used over the internet. It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, which is responsible for communication within a local network (LAN). A MAC address is used to uniquely identify devices on a local network, such as a Wi-Fi or Ethernet network.

## IP address

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network, allowing it to communicate with other devices over the internet or local network.

There are two types of IP addresses:

1. IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4): This is the most commonly used format, consisting of four sets of numbers (each between 0 and 255), separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

2, IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6): A newer format designed to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the internet. IPv6 addresses are much longer, containing eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

IP addresses serve two main purposes:

1. Identification: They identify a device on a network.

2. Location addressing: They indicate the location of a device on a network, allowing for proper routing of data between devices.

IP address is used over the internet to identify devices and route data between them. It operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and is essential for communication across networks, including the internet.

## OSI Model

Standardizes communication in computer systems. Internet runs on this, phones runs on this, LAN, router.

Stands for Open systems interconnection model.
