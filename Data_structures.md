# Data Structures
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures. 

### Classification of Data Structure

It has mailny 2 types:

1. Linear Data Structure
2. Non-linear data structure

#### Linear Data Structure

Linear Data Structure: Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 
Example: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc.

It has mainly 2 types:

1. Static linear ds.
2. Dynamic linear ds

 Static Data Structure: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure.
