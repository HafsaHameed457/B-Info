# Data Structures
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures. 

### Classification of Data Structure

It has mailny 2 types:

1. Linear Data Structure
2. Non-linear data structure

#### Linear Data Structure

Linear Data Structure: Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 
Example: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc.

It has mainly 2 types:

1. Static linear ds.
2. Dynamic linear ds

    Static Data Structure: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 

    Dynamic Data Structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 
    Example: Queue, Stack, etc.


#### Non- linear data structure

Non-Linear Data Structure: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 
Examples: Trees and Graphs.


## Types of ds


1. Array:
Array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type. Elements are allocated contiguous memory, allowing for constant-time access. Each element has a unique index number.

2. Matrix/Grid
Matrix is a two-dimensional array of elements, arranged in rows and columns. It is represented as a rectangular grid, with each element at the intersection of a row and column.

3. String
String is a sequence of characters, typically used to represent text. It is considered a data type that allows for the manipulation and processing of textual data in computer programs.

4. Stack
Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Stacks play an important role in managing function calls, memory, and are widely used in algorithms, web development, and systems like compilers and browsers.
